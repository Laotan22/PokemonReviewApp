# PokemonReviewApp
The project I used to learn .Net Web API. Allows you to review and rate different Pokemon owned by different users.
This project is my introductory project in .NET Core Web API design and implementation using Entity Framework.
The project has fat controllers and no services. I created several endpoints for different functionalities to demonstrate all four CRUD operations.
The project also contains an authentication controller which I developed using JWTs.
Other functionalities include image uploads to a local database.
